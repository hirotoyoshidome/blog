<p>There are only a few days left in 2025.</p>
<p>Every year I try to set some kind of challenge for myself, almost like a light goal, and this year I took on a pretty big one.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge was changing the way I work from being a full-time employee to becoming a freelancer.</p>
<h3 id="from-full-time-employee-to-freelancer">From Full-time Employee to Freelancer</h3>
<p>For a handful of reasons I ended up freelancing more by circumstance than by design, but ever since I started this line of work I had wanted to experience freelancing at least once, so the opportunity gave me the push I needed and turned into a great experience.</p>
<p>What I feel most strongly is that you never know unless you actually try.</p>
<p>In the past I had thought about freelancing or even starting a company several times, but most of that stayed within the realm of researching, summarizing, and running numbers in spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Thinking has this trait where, once you cross a certain threshold, it can make you feel as if you have already done the thing.</p>
<p>If all you do is think and the risks still outweigh the benefits, you probably will not act, but the thinking itself is not wasted—that is the mindset I had.</p>
<p>I still hold that philosophy quite strongly and have no intention of denying it. If anything, I think avoiding risks that can be avoided is a healthy stance.</p>
<p>Because I had already thought through it several times, when I suddenly had to change jobs this time around, the transition to freelancing went surprisingly smoothly.</p>
<p>Once I actually became a freelancer, though, a world I had never seen before came into view.</p>
<p>You have to understand your standing as a freelancer inside an organization, stay on top of taxes and social insurance, handle invoicing—things I never had to think about as an employee suddenly became my responsibility.</p>
<p>At the same time I could see the downside of how much time gets consumed by tasks that are unrelated to the core work.</p>
<p>Thanks to modern accounting software and generative AI, it is far easier now than it used to be. (I honestly feel that without ChatGPT I would have lost much more time.)</p>
<p>Still, I want to personally understand the rules and the calculations for each payment, so it ends up taking a fair amount of time, and that is something I only grasped after becoming a freelancer.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether I conclude that this style of work does not suit me after all or that it is actually a lot of fun, the fact that I have strong conviction either way after trying it once is the biggest lesson I gained.</p>
<h3 id="coding-agents-and-design">Coding Agents and Design</h3>
<p>One more major trend—and the change in my mindset—that I want to write about this year is coding agents.</p>
<p>Generative AI has become fully mainstream, and coding agents have spread widely throughout the software industry.</p>
<p>Their accuracy is now impressively high.</p>
<p>With that backdrop, I started seriously studying software design this year.</p>
<p>Until now I could not really say I had studied design systematically.</p>
<p>Of course, I occasionally designed features at work, but most of the time I relied on prior experience to guide my design decisions.</p>
<p>I often limited my thinking to ensuring data consistency and called it a day.</p>
<p>My growing interest in design was partly driven by career considerations, but it also relates to the rise of coding agents.</p>
<p>From a career perspective, it has been eight full years since I started working as a software engineer.</p>
<p>The web is my main battlefield, but thanks to startup experience I have worked across nearly every phase of software development, from cloud infrastructure to backend development.</p>
<p>At the same time, I could not always explain the meaning behind each choice.</p>
<p>For example, even when deciding how to structure directories or where to split logic, I could not justify my decisions with confidence and often relied on intuition and vibes.</p>
<p>I wanted to clearly articulate that vague feeling and develop a systematic understanding of design—that was the driver behind my growing interest.</p>
<p>With coding agents now available, AI can generate much of the code for you.</p>
<p>But if you give them a sloppy prompt, you will get disposable, low-quality code.</p>
<p>That is where design knowledge becomes valuable.</p>
<p>By communicating the background and intent of the design to the AI, you can get much better code out of it.</p>
<p>In other words, in software development where we co-create with coding agents, I feel that design knowledge will carry even more weight.</p>
<p>I gave two reasons for diving into design in earnest, and after studying it I already feel the benefit of how it changes my mindset even at the individual coding level.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead-to-2026">Looking Ahead to 2026</h2>
<p>I feel that 2025 was full of discoveries that could grow into something more.</p>
<p>That means 2026 will be a phase for nurturing those buds.</p>
<p>When it comes to design in particular, I am not focused on specific methods so much as learning different ways of thinking and expanding my perspective. That makes the content feel difficult at times, but because I can already see the results in practice, I want to expose myself to many more design philosophies in 2026.</p> <section class="mt-10 border-t pt-6 space-y-8"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-3 items-center"> <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">Share:</span> <a class="text-sm px-3 py-1.5 rounded border hover:bg-gray-50" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Looking%20Back%20on%202025&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhirotoyoshidome.com%2Fen%2Fposts%2F2025%2F2025-a-year-in-review%2F" rel="noopener">
