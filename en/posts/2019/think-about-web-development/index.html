<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>These are my thoughts from my latest job hunt.</p>
<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>
<p>I am 22 and this was my second job search. I live in Sapporo now—short commutes, lower rent, warm people. I love it here and would rather not leave. But after combing through Green and Wantedly for a month or two, even with filters set, I realized how few openings exist locally, especially for startups. Tokyo still dominates in headcount and job volume.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-decided-to-move-on">Why I decided to move on</h3>
<p>The biggest factor was the work itself. I am the same age as new grads but started working two years earlier (dropped out of college), so I am entering my third year. My first transition was simply “web company outside Tokyo.” This time I wanted to think about the future: launching services, operating them from scratch—things that are hard to learn solo. That pushed me toward startups that aligned with my interests.</p>
<h3 id="on-complacency">On “complacency”</h3>
<p>This may sound like a rant, but some interviews made me feel that the learning mindset toward technology was relaxed—not dress codes or snacks, but attitude toward growth. Tech evolves fast compared with when I started coding. Internal-only skills (like company-specific politics) are replaceable; what matters is value recognized outside, via output, study sessions, conferences. Some companies encourage this, but they are the minority. The “complacency” really hit me during this search.</p>
<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>
<p>Continuous learning is the only option. If you cannot keep up, you leave. I want to keep that in mind.</p> <section class="mt-10 border-t pt-6 space-y-8"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-3 items-center"> <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">Share:</span> <a class="text-sm px-3 py-1.5 rounded border hover:bg-gray-50" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Thoughts%20While%20Job%20Hunting%20in%20Web%20Development&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhirotoyoshidome.github.io%2Fblog%2Fen%2Fposts%2F2019%2Fthink-about-web-development%2F" rel="noopener">
